It is recommended to use dash or ksh as the default system shell (/bin/sh).
Picochan uses the functions os.execute() and io.popen(), which make use of
/bin/sh to execute commands. On most Linux systems, this is a symlink to bash.
GNU bash is highly insecure, and for security reasons, consider replacing
the /bin/sh symlink with a less insecure shell.
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_(software_bug) for further details.

Creating the database:

  $ sqlite3 picochan.db <picochan.sql

Point your web browser at the picochan installation. Log in as an admin using
the username 'setup' and the password 'password'. Use this account to create a
new administrator account using your username and a different password. Then,
delete the setup account. Picochan is now ready to use.

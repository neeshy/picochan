---> INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS <---

THESE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS ARE FOR PICOCHAN 2.7 OR ABOVE.

Picochan is very easy to install. Its dependencies are:

  DEPENDENCY        TESTED VERSION   DISTRIBUTION URL
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  luajit            2.0.5            https://luajit.org/
  sqlite            3.34.0           https://sqlite.org/

On a freshly installed Gentoo system, Picochan was made to work by first
installing the following packages through portage. The relevant USE flags are
also given (your results may vary if you do not follow the USE flags listed,
for example, thumbnails for AV1-encoded videos may not be generated if you
do not enable the dav1d USE-flag for ffmpeg).

  app-crypt/argon2
  dev-db/sqlite
  dev-lang/luajit           USE="lua52compat"
  media-fonts/corefonts
  media-gfx/imagemagick     USE="jpeg png webp svg openmp bzip2 zlib"
  media-video/ffmpeg        USE="dav1d vpx x264 x265 gpl"
  net-misc/curl             USE="ssl"

It is optional but recommended to remove bash as your system shell (/bin/sh).
Picochan uses the functions os.execute() and io.popen(), which make use of
/bin/sh to execute commands. On most Linux systems, this is a symlink to bash.
GNU bash is highly insecure, and for security reasons, consider replacing
the /bin/sh symlink with a less insecure shell, such as app-shells/dash.

  # emerge app-shells/dash app-eselect/eselect-sh
  # eselect sh set dash

---> FINAL PREPARATIONS <---

Create the database:

  $ sqlite3 picochan.db <picochan.sql

Point your web browser at the picochan installation. Log in as an admin using
the username 'setup' and the password 'password'. Use this account to create a
new administrator account using your username and a different password. Then,
delete the setup account. Picochan is now ready to use.

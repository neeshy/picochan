Note that Picochan uses the functions os.execute() and io.popen(), which make
use of /bin/sh to execute commands. It is recommended to use dash or ksh as the
default system shell.

Create the database:

  $ sqlite3 picochan.db <picochan.sql

Create the media directory:

  $ mkdir Media Media/icon Media/thumb

Configure your web server. A barebones/sample nginx configuration is included
below. Note that nginx does not natively support CGI and thus requires a
wrapper program in order to call CGI scripts. fcgiwrap is recommended for this
purpose.

http {
    server {
        listen 80 default_server;
        server_name picochanwvqfa2xsrfzlul4x4aqtog2eljll5qnj5iagpbhx2vmfqnid.onion;
        root /srv/picochan;

        location /Media {
        }

        location /Static {
        }

        location / {
            include fastcgi_params;
            fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root/pico.cgi;
            fastcgi_param PATH_INFO $uri;
            fastcgi_pass unix:/run/fcgiwrap/fcgiwrap.sock;
        }
    }
}

Point your web browser at the picochan installation. Log in as an admin using
the username 'setup' and the password 'password'. Use this account to create a
new administrator account using your username and a different password. Then,
delete the setup account. Picochan is now ready to use.
